==========================

Quick instructions
------------------

This data directory should be owned by the user/group which run the HTTP server.

You have to create subdirectories:

  *   `cache`: this is where sample-app store its cached files (ex: twig, assets, etc.)
  *   `log`: this is where sample-app logs stuff
